# CircularRainbow
The code starts by creating a group element with the el attribute set to "group".
 The transform property of this group is translated by half the width and height of the renderer.
 This creates a rectangle that will be used as an outer container for all other elements.
 The next step in the code is to create 100 circles, each with a radius of 5 pixels, using i2d's chain method.
 Each circle has its own animation function which loops through 100 times and then calls animateEachCircle().
 The code is a simple example of how to animate an SVG group.
